# Project-Robotic-Dog
This project implements a quadruped robot dog with inverse kinematics-based locomotion control. The robot features four legs with 2 degrees of freedom (DOF) each and a gimbal-controlled head mechanism. The control system uses a trot gait pattern and includes forward, reverse, and turning movements.
